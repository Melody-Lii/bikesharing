## New York City

There are 2,344,224 bike riders using the bike sharing in New York City. 1.9 Million of those riders are subscribers which indicates a long term earning potential. Majority of the bike users are between the age of 23-46 years old.

## Des Moines vs NYC
The US Census information from July 2019 was used to make comparisons between the two cities. Des Moines has a similar percentage of population between the age group of 18-65 years old. 

## Conclustion
 Des Moines has population of 214,237, whereas NYC has population of 8,336,817. But most people in Des Moines would prefer to ride a bike, which opens a big opportunity to make business with citibike there.
